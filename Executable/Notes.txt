Optimization : 

Shaders don't have extra variables.
Create as little variables as you can.

Heightmap Shader uses one color channel for each texture alpha

Optimize Meshes

If needed, write distance algorithm for picking

Normalize all normals

Remember to recheck mouse algorithms! Problems were found when it was 2D tested!




7/22 - Continued to work on cell shading engine. The problem with the cell shading engine occurred 
because of linear filtration. With point filtration, the problem is completely mitigated. 
Improved naming of variables in shaders and placed GetTechniques in Effects class function.
(2 Hours)

7/23 - Cleaned sloppy rendering codes. Calibrated cell texture slightly. Encountered bloom shader problem;
Bloom doesn't look well with cell shading. Reordered draw order so bloom doesn't affect cell shaded objects.
Encountered problem with new order. Bloom will overlap if not occupied beforehand. Created new shader
pass in the cell shader to prevent glitch. Began work on outline engine. Found out that FVFs were old and
deprecated and unflexible. Learned about vertex declarations.

7/24 - Continued work on outline engine.
(2 Hours)

7/26 - Continued work on outline engine. Began first runtime tests. Tests failed. Frames were one frame behind.
Fixed problem by adding a CommitChanges function call. Fixed mouse offsets according to 2D program experiences.
