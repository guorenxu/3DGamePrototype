This is a 3D game prototype I wrote as a challenge for myself during my last year in high school. I stopped working on it because I found out about Unity3D.

Features:
Terrain generation from binary RAW file
Point and click movement of character, done by raytracing with terrain
Toon and outline shaders
Import of modified OBJ file to draw "stonehenge" objects

**Instructions**

NOTE: The executable may only run on older PCs.

To run the program, please double click the "Star Engine.exe" file inside the "3D Engine Program" directory.
To Quit : Press Escape
To move your circle around : Left click on the terrain
To move the camera : Right click and drag

All artworks were done by my brother Bangren Xu.
